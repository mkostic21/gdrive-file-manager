#GDrive File Manager

This little program is supposed to be used from a flash drive.
It was made for personal use, but later decided to make it public.

Once you put the .exe with its dependencies in a folder. It scans outside 'that' folder and recursively scans through files and folders on your flash drive.
If a file or folder doesn't exist on Google Drive, it makes a new folder/file there and if there's a missmatch in date of modification of a file, it replaces the old version with a new one on the Drive (files on your flash drive are never touched).
